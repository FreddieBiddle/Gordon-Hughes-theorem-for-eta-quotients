This function takes in a list of tuples [(a1, b1), (c1, d1), ...]
representing an eta-quotient eta(a1 * z)^b1 * eta(a2 * z)^b2 * ...
and tells you whether it is modular or not. If it is, it gives you the
q-expansion, level, weight, and character of the eta-quotient, as well
as its order at the cusps of Gamma0(N).
