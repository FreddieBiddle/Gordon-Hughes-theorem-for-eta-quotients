EtaProd takes in a list of tuples 

                [(a1, b1), (c1, d1), ...]
representing an eta-quotient 

            eta(a1 * z)^b1 * eta(a2 * z)^b2 * ...,

as well as a precision MM for q-series and an optional third argument 
"info" (enter 1 or leave None) for info on level, weight, character, and 
order at the cusps of Gamma0(N).

EtaProd will tell you if your input represents a modular form or not.
